# Chains-gen

chains-gen is a simple little program to create a Markov chain and then generate text with it.

To use it, put your training data inside `data.txt` in a directory, and then run the program there.

> Try to keep each entry of data contained in one line and not bleeding out into multiple. (The results will be better)

If everything is okay you should be able to hit enter and generate sentences.
